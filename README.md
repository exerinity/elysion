# elysion
A very, *VERY* simple bot basically providing random info.

# Why? This is a waste of everything!
I was getting tired of not having every drop of information right at my fingertips on Discord, and even all the Vencord plugins wern't enough. 

This gives you all the information available via the Discord API. I hope, at least.

Also, this bot is very lightweight, requiring only 3 packages. I'm working on sanding it down to just one (discord.js).

It's that simple you could probably do it in your sleep.
